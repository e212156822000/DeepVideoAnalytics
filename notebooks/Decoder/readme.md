# Visual Search aided decoding for intelligent video analytics

Visual Data specifically videos, have potential to advance in Computer Vision by providing not only
information about contents of an image but also temporal and cause-effect relationship between objects, scenes & actions.
Unlike images using videos is significantly more expensive due to storage & processing costs. We strongly believe that 
an "intelligent & distributed" video decoding pipeline combined with ability to maintain fine & broad annotations is 
essential for progress. 

In this post I will outline how Deep Video Analytics platform with its visual search capabilities & distirbuted decoding 
approach can enable researchers to quickly build complex processing pipelines to leverage large streaming & recorded videos.
